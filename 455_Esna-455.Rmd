# Column Summits (455-472) {-}  
  
The elaborate column capitals (described and translated in *Esna* II and *Esna* III) are surmounted by stone cubes, which support the architraves. Typically each face is decorated with royal cartouches, and the king is beloved of various local divinities. 

The columns from the facade (455-460) are fairly simple, and will be briefly described, not translated. However the inscriptions on the columns of the interior (461-472) feature complex visual puns, and those will translated with commentary  below.
