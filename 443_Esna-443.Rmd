These reliefs contain a combination of Zodiac signs, planets,[^fn-443-0] decans, and "arrows" of Bastet-Sekhmet,[^fn-443-1] all from the northern sky. Only traces of their captions are preserved in paint, but they can be identified based on parallels on other astronomical scenes, for which see @mendel-himmel, pp. 454-457.  

[^fn-443-0]: With the notable exceptions of Venus and Mercury: @lieven-himmel, pp. 156-157.
[^fn-443-1]: For the arrows of Bastet, see primarily @sauneron-tutu, pp. 278-281; @rondot-arrows, pp. 264-265; @rondot-tutu, pp. 314-321.

For the Zodiac signs from this table, see already @sauneron-4, p. xiv. One might compare the similar representations from the round zodiac of Dendera: @aubourg, p. 4, and photos from the [Louvre](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010028871){target="_blank"}. For general interest, I note some of the highlights below.
