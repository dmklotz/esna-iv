The sky is radiant  
with the great stars,[^fn-400-1]  
the moon shines between them   
beside the sun disk,  
like Osiris in the Isle of Flames.  
  
These gods  
create the gods and goddesses,  
mammals, birds, fish, snakes,  
the bodies of all that exists on earth,  
all by themselves.  
  
It is they who issue decisions  
in the entire earth;  
they reckon all things  
in heaven and earth,  
beside Re and the moon,   
the twin luminaries.

[^fn-400-1]: 
![](./images/400_1.png){width=22%} - The *m* and eye-sign appear to have swapped places, as one would expect an adjective or stative verb to modify the noun here. Similar perturbed sign order occurs later on in this text (*šsr=sn* ***m*** *r'=sn*).

The living Bas of the gods,  
who encircle the throne of Re (the sky),  
who revolve around[^fn-400-1a] the two firmaments,   
daily;  
the messenger gods of the nomes,  
who shoot their arrows from their mouths  
against all those whom they behold   
from afar:  
on this day,  
in this month,  
in this year,  
and in all their hours.

[^fn-400-1a]: For the reading, see @kurth-olz, p. 26 (citing a similar passage in *Edfou* VIII, 109, 2).

This is Isis as a hippopotamus,[^fn-400-2]  
lassoing the Big Dipper  
in the northern sky,  
lest he be allowed to descend  
to the Duat.  
    
He remains with her,  
as Ipet-weret in the sky;  
her arm shall never release him,   
for all eternity.  

</div>

[^fn-400-2]: This text about Ipet-weret occurs immediately next to the two representations of this goddess in [Esna 399], A, as noted by [Christian Leitz](https://youtu.be/WGZiRJfNYZI?t=1293). The scene with Ipet-weret and the Great Dipper is actually represented elsewhere on Travée B, [Esna 409], 40. See also [Esna 450], 3.
