## Esna 444 {-}

- Date: Marc[us Aurelius?]
- Bibliography: @lieven-himmel, pp. 152-154; Pl. 7; @mendel-himmel, pp. 457-458

NB: This text was only painted, and Sauneron did not record any signs in his edition. Preliminary copies were made by @lieven-himmel, Pl. 7, and @mendel-himmel, p. 457, both based on photographs. Presumably more signs will be revealed when this portion of the ceiling is fully cleaned. At present, the text is recorded only in fragments.

The inscription mentions various epithets of local goddesses, including Menhit, Nebtu, and Neith. Several words appear to be spelled with multiple uraeus or sky signs, just like in the hymn to Neith from column 13: [*Esna* III, 331](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna3/column-13-328-336.html#esna-331){target="_blank"}.
