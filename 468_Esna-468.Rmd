[^fn-468-1]: The interpretation of the epithets remain highly speculative. There are three ideograms of Menhyt, and at least two signs (cow goddess and cow) which could write *nb.t*, "lady." Nonetheless, the most common epithets preceding *ʿšȝ-ḥb.w* for both Menhyt and Nebtu are *nb.t-wpy* and *nb.t-tḫ*. Perhaps for the first, the figure of Nut writes *nb.t*, while the seated cow writes wp because of her horns. In the second example, the final Menhyt figure could be an ideogram for *tḫ*, "inebriation."
