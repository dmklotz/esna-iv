[^fn-462-1]: The understanding of the epithets here are based on *Esna* III, 350, 8-9 = *Esna* VI, 475, 6-7, where most of the same phrases occur, albeit in slightly different order. Presumably the ideogram of Amun writes both *aA*, "great" and *nfr*, "good"; the former value is well-attested elsewhere: @klotz-philae, p. 67, No. 14.  
[^fn-462-1b]: It is unclear how to read the Horus figure at the beginning of this line. It appears in the same position in [Esna 470], E, as well as at the beginning of two architrave texts: [Esna 424], 1; [Esna 431], 1. In the later two cases, it appears to write *wnn*, but could also just be an emblematic sign to begin the text. In all the surrounding texts from the column summits, one expects a form of the verb *rdỉ*, "to give" here.
