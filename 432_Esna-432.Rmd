[^fn-432-1]: ![](./images/432_3.png){width=35%} - @altmann-mond, p. 459, read this quite differently: "der hitzige Stier (?), der die ,,Ferne'' holt mit seiner Gestalt," and noted the unusual spelling of *psỉ*. The sphinx most likely writes the uniliteral *s* here, as elsewhere at Esna: @sauneron-61, pp. 237-238.  For the baboon sign, I have elsewhere argued for the reading *ỉp-wḏȝ.t*, instead of the expected *ỉnỉ-ḥr.t*, "he who brings the distant eye" = "Onuris", based on similar passages at Esna: @klotz-baboons, p. 57). Not only am I unaware of texts which identify the full moon with Onuris, but that epithet is not typically modified with adverbial phrases as here. See also a similar epithet in a newly uncovered inscription in [Esna 418], 8: "Isden the great, who reckons the *wedjat*-eye in his manifestation": @mendel-himmel, p. 434
[^fn-432-2]: This is an epithet for the sun during the full moon, the counterpart to the "Blazing Bull" mentioned above during the "meeting of the Two Bulls (*snsn-kȝ.wy*), the "syzygy" of sun and moon.

[^fn-432-3]: One would expect instead a participle of the verb *twȝ*, "to support; lift up" instead here. Compare a very similar sequence in [Esna 436].
