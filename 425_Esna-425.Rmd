NB: This text and [Esna 427] include multiple epithets identifying Neith with a cobra (Wadjyt) and vulture (Nekhbet). These clearly relate to the series of vulture- and cobra-headed vultures on the central panel of the ceiling: [Esna 426].

She She stop her Papyrus shines,[^fn-425-1]  
from the pure field,  
in her form of the mysterious vulture,  
having reached Esna in happiness,   
  
She opens her arms (i.e. wings):  
protecting Temple of the Chicks,   
guarding the gods in the Temple of Neith.    
She joins together her wings,    
while protecting *Rs.t-ḥw.wt=s*.[^fn-425-2]    
   
She guards the August Djed-pillar

she appears from his temple,  
and she shines as the uraeus on his head,  
and she sets her arrows  
against whomever would plot against him.

[^fn-425-1]: This is an epithet of the serpentine Wadjet nearby in [Esna 426], 16; see also *LGG* V, 437c-438a. It is also a good description of the cobra on a papyrus which appears in [Esna 401], C, top right corner. 

[^fn-425-2]: For Neith as a vulture protecting Re and other divinities within Esna, see especially [Esna II, 160](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/intercolumnar-wall-f-and-south-east-door-57-64.html#esna-60), 2-3. It appears something is missing after the verb *ḫwỉ*. *Rs.t-ḥw.wt=s* is an epithet of Neith, so presumably she should be the one protecting other divinities.

[^fn-425-3]: Following @kurth-olz, p. 27, who noted similarities with the symmetric text [Esna 427], which links Nekhbet to the white crown.

[^fn-425-4]: ![](./images/425_1.png){width=20%} - @lieven-himmel, pp. 104-105, read: *šnʿ ỉyỉ nb m kkw*, "abgewehrt wird jeder, der in der Dunkelheit kommt." However, the symmetric text ([Esna 427]) has a similar formulation, where the verb must be *rdỉ*, "to give":  ![](./images/427_1.png){width=15%}. This could just be an active participle, further modifying the epithets of Neith. But since both texts add a persuasive argument (*mỉ-nty ntf*...), this might instead be the non-suppletive imperative form, attested in Old Egyptian and later in archaizing texts.

[^fn-425-5]: The emperor Titus incorporated the name of his father, Vespasian, in his royal titulary. That this particular inscription dates to Titus is clear from the symmetric text ([Esna 427]), and nearby cartouches on the central row including the element "Titus": [Esna 426], [Esna 429]. See @sauneron-3, p. 392. Nonetheless, nearby [Esna 431] belongs to Vespasian, and he also appears on the column capitals: [Esna 457], [Esna 458], [Esna 459]. So work on the central row began under Vespasian, but was completed by his Flavian successors Titus and Domitian.
